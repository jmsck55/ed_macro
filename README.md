# ed_macro
The future of "ed_macro"

Make a Euphoria v3.1.1 version of ed_macro.ex for DOS and early Windows.  Make a separate 64-bit version as well.

- [x] DOS32, Win32, and Win64 work with limited support for some features.

Make a Web version of ed_macro for Chrome like modern browsers.  Record touch and mouse clicks and keyboard and button clicks.

Try to limit its functionality so that it won't become a killer app.

* Hexadecimal display.
* Open binary files.
* Large file support.
* Memory doubly linked lists.
